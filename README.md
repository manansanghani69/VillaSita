# üèóÔ∏è VILASITA - Construction and Interior Design Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my summer internship project! This project showcases the design and development of a comprehensive website named "VILASITA" for a construction and interior design company. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform with various functionalities, including multiple routes for different sections, and to integrate a mail sending feature using Node.js to facilitate communication between users and the admin.

## üöÄ Introduction

During this internship, I developed a website for VILASITA, a construction and interior design company. The website includes multiple sections such as the homepage, About Us, Contact Us, Process, and FAQs. A key feature is the mail sending functionality integrated using Node.js and Nodemailer to allow users to send messages directly to the admin.
